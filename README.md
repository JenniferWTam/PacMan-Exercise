# Pacman-Exercise
## Description
### If you've ever played an arcade game, then you're familiar with Pac-Man!
We are not building the full PacMan game in this activity. However, we will be building a feature of this game, which displays and moves PacMan from one side of the screen to the other.<br>

## Future Improvements
I would like be able to add a yellow circle in front of Pacman's mouth to emulate the original Pacman games a little more.
